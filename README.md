# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs 
Practicing different available versions and codes for Generative Models such as GANs and Autoencoder:

# Stanford University School of Engineering-CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
Lecture 11 | Generative Models
Spring 2019
, Lecture 13 | Generative Models Spring 2017

In Lecture 11 they move beyond supervised learning, and discuss generative modeling as a form of unsupervised learning. They cover the autoregressive PixelRNN and PixelCNN models, traditional and variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Keywords: Generative models, PixelRNN, PixelCNN, autoencoder, variational autoencoder, VAE, generative adversarial network, GAN
