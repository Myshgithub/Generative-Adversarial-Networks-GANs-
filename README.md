In Lecture 11 they move beyond supervised learning, and discuss generative modeling as a form of unsupervised learning. They cover the autoregressive PixelRNN and PixelCNN models, traditional and variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Keywords: Generative models, PixelRNN, PixelCNN, autoencoder, variational autoencoder, VAE, generative adversarial network, GAN
